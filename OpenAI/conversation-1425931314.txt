OpenAI response for Prompt:- tell me the full form of chat GPT using Ok 

I'm sorry for any confusion, but "ChatGPT" is actually the name of the model itself and does not have a traditional "full form" or acronym. It is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model, which is a type of artificial intelligence model that has been trained on a large amount of text data and can generate human-like text based on prompts provided to it. The "Chat" part of the name simply indicates that this particular variant is designed to engage in conversational dialogue with users.
